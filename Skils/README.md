Perfect ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs **rank the skills by frequency and importance** based on all the JDs you provided. I‚Äôll split them into **High-Priority (core must-have)** and **Medium-Priority (nice-to-have / less frequent)**.

## üîπ High-Priority / Must-Have Skills

(Repeated in almost all JDs, essential for DevOps/SRE roles)

* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Cloud Deployment Manager)
* Docker (containerization)
* Kubernetes / GKE (orchestration, scaling)
* AWS core services (EC2, S3, ECS, EKS, RDS, IAM, ELB, Lambda)
* GCP core services (Compute Engine, GKE, Functions, Storage, IAM, KMS, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run, Bigtable, Resource Manager)
* DevSecOps principles / API security / Authentication & Authorization frameworks
* Monitoring & logging (CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, New Relic, Sumo Logic, Dynatrace)

## üîπ Medium-Priority / Nice-to-Have Skills

(Occasionally mentioned, adds extra value)

* Large-scale Kubernetes cluster optimization
* Ansible (automation/configuration management)
* Artifactory

üí° **Interpretation:**

* **High-Priority:** Skills you must master for interviews and daily work.
* **Medium-Priority:** Skills you should be familiar with or learn gradually for added advantage.

If you want, I can **also generate a final ‚Äúflat comma-separated ranked list‚Äù**, **High-Priority first, then Medium-Priority**, so you can use it directly for resume, LinkedIn, or interview prep.

Do you want me to do that?
